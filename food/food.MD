#煲仔飯 CLAYPOT RICE
煲仔飯的起源可以追溯到中國南方的農村地區。早在明清時期，廣東、福建等地的農民在勞動之餘，會將米、菜、肉等食材放入瓦煲中，用慢火燉煮，製作出美味的煲仔飯。這種烹調方式因簡單、便利、營養豐富而深受歡迎，逐漸流傳至香港。
我們邀請到了嚐囍煲仔小菜的康哥，分享了他對煲仔飯的見解以及如何使用AI進行記錄變化與創新的過程。

#流汁湯包 Juicy Steamed Buns
包子是一道歷史悠久的中國傳統美食，深受人們喜愛。最早可追溯至古代，因其方便攜帶且營養豐富，曾是勞工和旅人常食之物。隨著時間的推移，包子逐漸成為各地飲食文化中的重要組成部分，每個地區都發展出了獨特的餡料和風味。
在英國，「包子」常被誤認為是台灣的荷葉包，一種夾著滷肉的折疊式蒸包。為了打破這個刻板印象，並向大眾推廣真正的中式包子，廚師包創立了包公包子品牌。他的目標不僅是改變英國人對包子的認知，更希望將這種美味又鬆軟的傳統美食傳播得更遠。如今，隨著他的努力，越來越多的人開始了解並愛上真正的中式包子及其豐富的文化底蘊。
我們很榮幸邀請到廚師王，與我們分享她對包子的見解，探討這一傳統美食的深厚文化底蘊及其在現代社會的演變。身為兼具主廚與設計師雙重身分的創意人士，她不僅對烹飪有獨到的見解，也關注GenAI如何影響食品設計與未來餐飲藝術的發展。在本次交流中，她將分享自己的觀察與思考，探討由AI驅動的創造力如何塑造美食的未來。
Buns are a long-standing traditional Chinese food, beloved by many. Their origins can be traced back to ancient times, where they were a staple food for laborers and travelers due to their portability and nutritional value. Over time, buns have become an integral part of regional cuisines, with each area developing its own unique fillings and flavors.
In the UK, "buns" are often mistakenly associated with Taiwanese lotus leaf buns, a type of steamed bun with braised pork filling. To dispel this misconception and promote authentic Chinese buns, Chef Wang founded the Bao Gong Baozi brand. His goal is not only to change people's perception of buns in the UK, but also to spread this delicious and soft traditional food further. Thanks to his efforts, more and more people are now discovering and appreciating the true essence of Chinese buns and their rich cultural heritage.
We are honored to have Chef Wang join us to share her insights on buns, exploring the profound cultural significance of this traditional food and its evolution in modern society. As a creative individual with dual roles as a chef and designer, she has unique perspectives on both culinary arts and how GenAI impacts food design and the future of the food industry. In this discussion, she will share her observations and thoughts on how AI-driven creativity is shaping the future of food.
